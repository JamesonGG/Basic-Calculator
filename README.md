# Basic-Calculator
-goal is to creat a basic calculator that can compute an output based on one or two float inputs, and an operation.

-After downloading and extracting the program, there will be two boxes for input, a dropdown to select the operation, a button to run the computation,
and an output panel.
-You must enter two inputs, they do not have to be float's.
-For operations that only require one value (e.g. Absolute, and Factorial), only the first input (topmosst box) will be computed. The second input is discarded.

## TO-DO
  -Display text in window next to both input fields.
  -Rewrite the power function. As of now, any second inputs that are > 0 but < 1 will simply not generate an output, I didn't account for that.
