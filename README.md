# Basic-Calculator
-goal is to creat a basic calculator that can compute an output based on one or two float inputs, and an operation.

-After downloading and extracting the program, there will be two boxes for input, a dropdown to select the operation, a button to run the computation, and an output panel.

-You must enter two inputs, they do not have to be float's.

-For operations that only require one value (e.g. Absolute, and Factorial), only the first input will be computed. The second input is discarded.
